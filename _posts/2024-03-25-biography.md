# **Jordan Taranto**
## Explorer | Pilot | Scuba Diver | Engineer

Hey there, I'm Jordan Taranto, a scuba diver, wannabe pilot, and engineer with a passion for innovation and exploration. Whether I'm coding in Python or navigating the skies/ocean, I thrive on tackling challenges head-on and pushing the boundaries of what's possible. 

A photo of me with with my boss Robert Kinkade (rest in peace). I spent three and a half months in the Alaskan wilderness living in a tent and flying all over Alaska with him.

# Test Pilot School 
As a Research Fellow at the United States Air Force Test Pilot School, I had the privilege of working on drones and working with some of the best pilots in the world. I focused on building a modular platform to aid in teaching students of the Air Force Test Pilot School the flight characteristics of drones. Here are some photos of my time there 

Here I am in my office working in front of the famous [X15 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_X-15) which if you did not know was the fastest plane ever built.
